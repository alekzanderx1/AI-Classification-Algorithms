# NYU AI Fall 2021â€”Assignment 3

## Supervised Learning

Using the provided dataset, implement 3 different classification algorithms (k-nearest neighbor, perceptron, and decision tree) to determine whether a candidate gets the majority of votes. For this assignment, you will use python3 and (optionally) the numpy library for vector/matrix-based scientific computation in python.

## Data

The attached csv file contains all the data. The run file handles importing it and converting it to numpy arrays. A description of the dataset is in the run file.
